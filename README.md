Higher order tensor decomposition
=================================

Implements the symmetric higher order power method and uses it to find **non-negative** rank-one decompositions of **symmetric** higher order (real) tensors.
This is a very specific case of one possible generalization of the eigendecomposition of a matrix.

The use of the S-HOPM and its convergence properties are based on:
